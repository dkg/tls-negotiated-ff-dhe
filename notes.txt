writing draft for TLS negotiated DH parameters.

 * decide on ipr statement

 * problem statement:

   servers have no way to know that a client supports strong DHE.
   some widely deployed TLS clients only support 1024-bit DHE, and
   servers have no way of knowing if a connecting client is in that
   class.

   clients have no recourse if offered a bad set of DH parameters
   other than terminating the connection.

   clients also have no effective way of knowing if the DH parameters
   they've been offered has reasonable security properties.  some
   current clients test the size of P, but that's it -- i haven't
   found one that does primality testing, and no one should hvae to do
   primality testing on each DHE handshake.


 * I want:

   Clients to be able to advertise their support for strong groups

   Clients to be able to indicate their minimum level of cryptographic
   requirements for DH parameter selection

   Servers to be able to offer strong groups with confidence that
   their peer will not need to terminate the handshake

   Clients to have a low-cost mechanism for ensuring that the group
   chosen by the server meets their cryptographic expectations


questions:
----------

how many bytes to use for the designated value?  1 bytes: values >
200 are reserved for experimental/private use.  no endianness needed

what is the reference to use for the IKE groups?  I don't see it
listed at https://www.iana.org/protocols, despite the following two
tables of modulus/generator groups:
https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml#prime-generator-pairs
https://www.iana.org/assignments/eap-eke/eap-eke.xhtml#diffie-hellman

what about people who want DH > 8192?

what to recommend for range of exponents?  each group should have:

 generator
 prime
 secret range
 expected strength
